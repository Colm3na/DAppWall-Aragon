# To install in your DAO do:

1. 
```
dao install <name-of-your-dao>.aragonid.eth dappwallexp.open.aragonpm.eth 1.0.0 --env rinkeby
```

2. Then vote for it to be added into the DAO apps set.

3. Once the vote is enacted as 'Yes', run:

First, check your `dappwallexp` proxy address by doing:
`dao apps dappwalltest0.aragonid.eth --all  --env rinkeby`
<br>
It should appear as the last one of the apps list, as `permissionless app`.

Finally, execute:
```
dao acl create <your-daos-name>.aragonid.eth <dappwallexp-proxy-address>  INPUT_IP_ROLE <your-daos-voting-app-address> <your-daos-voting-app-address> --env rinkeby
```

4. You need to vote once more to grant permissions to this app.

5. DAppWall experimental version is now available in your DAO! ðŸ˜‰


### Notes

v2.0.0 is broken. UI doesn't work at all in this version.

Only possible interaction in the v2.0.0 is through the terminal and it is also quite hard since the smart contract only accepts byte32:

```
dao exec dappwalltest0.aragonid.eth 0xc95ede37405df941d090e5b8708753980eafab8d update 0x4b44212167dd9f9d56ad291d551173e648b584cfeaf188b55bb95121282aabbd --env rinkeby
  âœ– Generating transaction
    â†’ Given parameter is not bytes: "3.404383790239593e+76"
    Sending transaction
 âœ– Given parameter is not bytes: "3.404383790239593e+76"
```

A script using the `web3.util.fromAscii` function would be required.

# To run this repo in your local machine do:
```
npx aragon run
```
or
```
npm run start:app
```
and then 
```
npm run start:aragon:http
```
(this last option is better for debugging)


Then check the Private key for the Address #1 that aragonAPI will automatically generate for you. You need to connect to Metamask on the browser and then:
1. First connect to the local 8545 network
2. Import the account to Metamask using the private key. You can call it something like aragon-test-local.

Now you can use your first Aragon DApp in a local environment.

Note: it takes a while to load on the browser.

# In a fresh installation

Recently I upgraded to Ubuntu Bionic and had a clean install. I realized there that I had to run

```
npm install --save core-js
npm install --save regenerator-runtime 
npm install --save @aragon/ui
```

first before being able to run a successfull `npx aragon run`.
Also I had to install python2.7 before all these steps, since apparently node-gyp requires this old python version. To install it, just run 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python2.7
```
